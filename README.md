# music-system-python
ABSTRACT

it is advanced Music Player GUI application. It is used to play the all songs whatever in the your system
main adavantage of this application is automatically scan the all directories and find the .mp3 files 
in this application I create 6 buttons like
1.play – it is used to play the songs 
2.stop – it is used to stop the current song If you want to continue that song click play button
3.pause – it is used to pause the your song
4.un pause – it Is used to unpause the whatever you pause the song
5.previous – it is used to play the previous song after clicking this button
6.exit – it is used to exit this application with asking yes or no permisssion.

And also I create a listbox to display the all the songs line by line
if song is playing it contain some color like red remaining songs are contain green color.
If complete all songs then show the some pop up message to continue to listen or not

it is very useful to listen music without adding any songs because automatically take songs form your system.

CHAPTER 1-INTRODUCTION
PYTHON 
Python Language Introduction
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
•	Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
•	Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
•	Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
•	Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.
Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.
Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python Features
Python's features include −
•	Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
•	Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
•	Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
•	A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
•	Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
•	Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
•	Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
•	Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
•	GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
•	Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −
•	It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
•	It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
•	It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
•	IT supports automatic garbage collection.
•	It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

Python graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
•	Tkinter − Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. We would look this option in this chapter.
•	wxPython − This is an open-source Python interface for wxWindows http://wxpython.org.
•	JPython − JPython is a Python port for Java which gives Python scripts seamless access to Java class libraries on the local machine http://www.jython.org.
There are many other interfaces available, which you can find them on the net.

CHAPTER-4 CONCLUSION

This project has really been faithful and informative. It has made us learn and understand the many trivial concepts of Python Language. As we have used python tkinter as a GUI it provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes to build a user friendly application.
The fast growing use of internet confirms the good future and scope of the proposed project.
Finally it has taught us a valuable lifelong lesson about the improvements and working and interacting in a group.
